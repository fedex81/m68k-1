1 ns = 1*10-9 s

Color clock: master clk/4 = cpu clk/2 

NTSC: 3,57954525 Mhz = 2,79365095329e-07 s = 279,3 ns
PAL:  3,546895 Mhz   = 2,81936736216e-07 s = 281,9 ns

1x CPU cycle = 140ns

CPU RAM access = 4 cycles (2 cycles address,2 cycles data transfer) = 560ns

1x DMA cycle = 280ns = 2 CPU cycles

CPU read/write = 2 cycles to setup address, 2 cycles for read/write

1 scanline = 227.5 DMA cycles = 227.5 * 280 ns = 63700ns = 455 CPU cycles/scanline
